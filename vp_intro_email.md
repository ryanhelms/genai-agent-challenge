Subject: Welcome to the Future of AI-Powered Executive Operations

Dear Team,

I'm excited to introduce an initiative that represents the next evolution of how we think about executive productivity and AI integration at our organization. As VP of Edge AI, I've been obsessing over a simple question: What if we could eliminate every friction point in executive workflows while simultaneously building the most advanced AI-powered digital assistant the industry has ever seen?

Today, we're launching the Vibe Coder-in-Residence program—a six-month sprint to transform how leadership operates in the age of artificial intelligence. This isn't just about automation; it's about creating a living, breathing digital twin that can think, write, and strategize with the same precision and insight that drives our most critical decisions.

Here's what we're building: Starting immediately, our Coder-in-Residence will shadow every meeting, every document review, every strategic conversation. They'll identify patterns, capture decision-making frameworks, and ship micro-agents daily that eliminate repetitive tasks. By day 30, we'll have at least five production agents running. By day 90, we'll have reduced my calendar load by 30% while simultaneously increasing our strategic output.

But here's where it gets interesting. Months 4-6 are dedicated to something unprecedented: building a digital twin that can draft emails, strategic briefs, and technical articles that are indistinguishable from my own writing. We're targeting a 70% confusion rate in blind evaluations—meaning peers won't be able to tell whether I wrote something or my AI twin did.

This isn't science fiction. This is the competitive advantage that will define the next decade of business operations. While other organizations are still debating whether to adopt AI, we're building the blueprint for AI-native leadership.

Every agent we build, every workflow we optimize, every breakthrough we achieve will be documented, open-sourced, and evangelized. We're not just solving our own problems—we're creating the playbook that will transform how every executive in every industry operates.

The metrics are non-negotiable: ship daily, measure everything, and optimize relentlessly. We'll track latency, adoption rates, and minutes saved with the same rigor we apply to our core product metrics. Because if we can't measure it, we can't improve it, and if we can't improve it, we're not moving fast enough.

This is more than a role—it's a founding engineer position for the future of executive AI. The person who joins us will be building something that doesn't exist anywhere else in the industry. They'll be working at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and real-world executive operations, with the freedom to experiment, the resources to scale, and the platform to share their innovations with the world.

I've always believed that the best way to predict the future is to build it. Starting now, we're building the future of AI-powered leadership. And in six months, when other VPs are still manually reviewing their calendars and drafting their own emails, we'll be operating at a level of efficiency and insight that seemed impossible just a year ago.

The future of work isn't coming—it's here. And we're going to show everyone exactly what it looks like.

Let's ship something extraordinary.

Best regards,

VP of Edge AI

P.S. If you're reading this and thinking "this sounds impossible," you're exactly the kind of person we need. The impossible is just another word for "not automated yet."
