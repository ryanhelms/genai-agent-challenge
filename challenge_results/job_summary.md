# Job Description Summary

## Position Overview
**Role**: Vibe Coder-in-Residence (GenAI Tech EA)
**Focus**: Shadow VP of Edge AI to build automated GenAI workflows and digital twin
**Duration**: 6-month program with aggressive milestones

## Key Timeline Milestones
- Day 1-30: Observe → Automate: Pair-shadow meetings, Teams, doc reviews. Ship micro-agents that cut repeat tasks (think: LLM-powered agenda generator, decision-tracker bot).
- Day 31-60: Scale → Compose: Chain agents together—calendar optimizer calls the meeting-minute bot which feeds the action-item tracker. Instrument with telemetry; cut human touchpoints by >25 %. Build a microsite "tech radar" that maps VP's Deep Research notes into visible tech-trends radar. Build a "team tracker" agent to generate the weekly status radar for whole of VP's org.
- Day 61-90: Externalize → Evangelize: Package best agents as internal templates. Produce a public demo or open-sourced repo; partner with Comms for media drops.
- Month 4-6: Digital Twin v1: Fine-tune a personal-style LLM and mult-agent fabric that drafts briefs and strategic emails and technical articles indistinguishable from the VP. Formal Turing evaluation: randomize % past emails into twin vs. VP variants, have peers label author; shoot for ≥ 70 % confusion before iterating toward BLEU 0.75 goal.

## Critical Requirements
- Haves
- Track record of shipping GenAI products in < 2 weeks cycles. Provide links or repos.
- Mastery of GenAI and agent frameworks (Langchain, MCP etc).
- Rapid full
- stack micro

## Success Metrics
- 70% confusion before iterating toward BLEU 0
- 5% production agents live by day 30
- 30% reduction in VP calendar load by day 90
- 2% external media features or conference demos by month 6
