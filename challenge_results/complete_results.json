  "intro_email": "Subject: Welcome to the Future of AI-Powered Executive Operations\n\nDear Team,\n\nI'm excited to introduce an initiative that represents the next evolution of how we think about executive productivity and AI integration at our organization. As Vice President of Edge AI, I've been obsessing over a simple question: What if we could eliminate every friction point in executive workflows while simultaneously building the most advanced AI-powered digital assistant the industry has ever seen?\n\nThis isn't just about automation; it's about creating a living, breathing digital twin that can think, write, and strategize with the same precision and insight that drives our most critical decisions. We're not just solving our own problems\u2014we're creating the playbook that will transform how every executive in every industry operates.\n\nStarting immediately, our Coder-in-Residence will shadow every meeting, every document review, every strategic conversation. They'll identify patterns, capture decision-making frameworks, and ship micro-agents daily that eliminate repetitive tasks. This is more than a role\u2014it's a founding engineer position for the future of executive AI.\n\nThe metrics are non-negotiable: ship daily, measure everything, and optimize relentlessly. We'll track latency, adoption rates, and minutes saved with the same rigor we apply to our core product metrics. Because if we can't measure it, we can't improve it, and if we can't improve it, we're not moving fast enough.\n\nThe future of work isn't coming\u2014it's here. And we're going to show everyone exactly what it looks like. Let's ship something extraordinary.\n\nBest regards,\n[VP Name]\nVP of Edge AI\n\nP.S. If you're reading this and thinking \"this sounds impossible,\" you're exactly the kind of person we need. The impossible is just another word for \"not automated yet.\"\n",
